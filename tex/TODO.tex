\chapter*{TO-DO list }
\begin{itemize}
    \item Read and write about the theory for multiple qubit states. (Boissonneault).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Increase the simulation to take of bigger Hilbert spaces.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Add noise and decoherence to the systems.
    \item We need to cover the coherent state representation to fully describe how a readout is made. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Introduce Coherent states and their properties
        \item Cover the probability functions and how we measure Q/Wigner? 
    \end{itemize}
