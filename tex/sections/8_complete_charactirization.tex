\chapter{Completely Characterizing the IQ Plane}
\newthought{This is somewhat the dream of the project. We want to characterize the full IQ plane to see how it looks for the single states and given different qubit parameters.}

\section{Fitting Differential Equations}
We need to start developing a way to fit a differential equation. This is done by the adjoint method/autograd through the process. 

\subsection{Ordinary Differential Equations}

\subsection{Stochastic Differentail Equations}
Will probably be the limit of what is possible. I would love to lay forward the framework and see if it works, but it will probably not do more than we would achive by simply comvolving the ordinary diff equation.
