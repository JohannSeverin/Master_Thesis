\chapter{The Transmon}
\newthought{This chapter} is setup as notes to the transmon and to go through the theory leading to it. It is also training in writing in this format, so stuff might look a bit weird. 

\section{Circuit QED}
The basis is superconducting qubits is to use circuits to form our potential. By choosing to make the qubits of superconducting material, the energy dissipation is removed from the system and at low enough energies/temperatures this system will behave quantized as a quantum system. 

Classically\footnote{Following is from the Quantum engineers guide to Superconducting Qubits}, we define the dynamics of a circuit in terms of its current $I(t)$ and its voltage drop $V(t)$. Now to write up the Lagrangian in flux/charge basis which are conjugated variables. Using flux basis we define:
\begin{equation}
    \Phi (t) = \int_{-\infty}^t V(t')dt'
\end{equation}
Now using this relations together with $V = L dI/dt$ and $I = C dV/dt$ it is possible to find the energy by:
\marginnote[0.5 cm]{The lower integration limit comes from the assumption that the system was at rest at infinity}
\begin{equation}
    E(t) = \int_{-\infty}^t V(t')I(t')dt'
\end{equation}
Such that the energy of the components are:
\begin{equation}
    E_{capacitor} = \frac12 C \dot{\Phi}^2; \quad E_{inductor} = \frac{1}{2L} \Phi^2
\end{equation}
Defining the capacitant energy as the kinetic energy $T_C$ and inductive energy as $U_L$, we can write the Lagrangian as:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = T_C - U_L = \frac12 C \dot{\Phi}^2 - \frac{1}{2L} \Phi^2
\end{equation}
And from this the Hamiltonian:\footnote{By defining a canonical momentum $Q = \partial \mathcal{L} / \partial \dot{\Phi}$ and doing the legendre transformation $\mathcal{H} = Q\dot{\Phi} - \mathcal{L}$.}:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{H} = \frac{1}{2C} Q^2 + \frac{1}{2L} \Phi^2
\end{equation}

\subsection{Going quantum}
$\Phi$ and $Q$ are classical, conjugate variables and satisfy the Poisson bracket:
\begin{equation}
    \{ \Phi, Q\} = \pfrac{\Phi}{\Phi}\pfrac{Q}{Q} - \pfrac{\Phi}{Q}\pfrac{Q}{\Phi} = 1
\end{equation}
To quantize these parameters, we replace the variables with the corresponding operators: $Q \to \hat{Q}$ and $\Phi \ \to \hat{\Phi}$. And using the correspondence principle to replace the Poisson brackets with the commutator $\{...\} \to i\hbar[...]$. We have:
\begin{equation}
    [\hat{\Phi}, \hat{Q}] = i\hbar
\end{equation}



\section{Cooper Pair Box}
As a start, we consider the LC-circuit which consist of a single capacitive element and one inducting. This exactly yields the Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H} = \frac{1}{2C} Q^2 + \frac{1}{2L} \Phi^2$. When considering a flux basis, we need 
\begin{marginfigure}[1 cm]
    \includegraphics[width = \linewidth]{tex/fig_for_text/LC_circuit.png}
    \caption{Circuit diagram for the LC circuit.}
\end{marginfigure}
\begin{equation}
    \hat{Q} = i\hbar \pfrac{}{\hat{\Phi}}
\end{equation}
for the commutator relation to be satisfied. Dropping the hats and setting $\hbar = 1$
\begin{equation}
    H \ket{\psi} = - \frac{1}{2C} \pfracsquared{}{\Phi}\ket{\psi} + \frac{1}{2L} \Phi^2 \ket{\psi}
\end{equation}
Here we can follow the derivations from harmonic oscillators and define the ladder operators, $a, a^\dagger$. Such that the the Hamiltonian can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    H = \omega (a^\dagger a + \frac12)
\end{equation}
Where $\omega = \sqrt{8 E_C E_L}$ can be found by comparing the hamiltonian with the one from the harmonic oscillator.

While the harmonic oscillator has an abundance of nice properties for physics, it has equidistant energy levels. Driving oscillations with the frequency $\omega$ will not only contribute to transitions in the computational basis ($\ket{0}, \ket{1}$), but also all states $\ket{n}$ where $n > 1$. With this leakage quantum computing will be impossible, and for this reason, we must search for an anharmonic potential.

\subsection{The Josephson Junction}
The solution lies in another component, which is accessible in the superconducting circuit. By separating two superconductors by a semiconducting material, the Cooper pairs will no longer travel through without resistance but will instead have a probability of tunneling through the insulator/superconductor. This probability is dependent on the phase difference between the two superconductors.
