The simulation is the module responsible for the time integration. Most of the functionality is collected in the `SimulationExperiment` - parent class which keeps track of sweeping, data storage, calculation of expectation values etc.. The `SimulationExperiment` is subclassed in order to provide a method for simulating. This allows us to to simulate using different models like Unitary, Lindblad or Stochastic simulations. 

The following subclasses are available:
- [[#Schrödinger Experiment]] allows unitary evolution without loss. This is however one dimensional and can go very fast.
- [[#Lindblad Experiment]] is a deterministic evolution using the Lindblad Master Equation to take care of decoherence and leakage due to interaction with the environment
- [[#Monte Carlo Experiment]] takes care of decoherence and losses to the environment by applying them stochastically. This means that we can approximate the Lindblad solution by dialing up the number of trajectories.
- **Not yet implemented:** [[#Stochastic Master Equation]] is used for simulating homodyne and heterodyne measurements of the system and how it behaves under continuous monitoring.

# Simulation Experiment Class
> [!NOTE]
> This class uses a  `Dataclass` to store data from simulation and save it. In the future this should be changed such that it comes in the same way as from the ´OPX_control´ library which is used in the lab.  

The `SimulationExperiment` call the overwritten `simulate` method to simulate a configuration. This now takes care of looping over the swept parameters defined in the [[Systems]] simulated. At the moment it supports sweeps over 1 or 2 parameters as well as the possibility to save the state or density matrix at each time in the simulation.




# Subclasses
> [!NOTE]
> Maybe move the subclasses to each its own file. It is probably nice with a guide how to use it and an example for each.
