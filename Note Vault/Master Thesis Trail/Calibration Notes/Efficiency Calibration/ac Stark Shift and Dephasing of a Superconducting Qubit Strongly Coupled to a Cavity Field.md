In this paper the effects of probing the resonator is determined by doing qubit spectroscopy after filling the resonator with photons. This gives rise to two effects. Firstly, the ac stark shift of the qubit getting moved by photons proportional to the power used to drive. Secondly, we see a broadening of the peak which is a result of the measurement back action on the qubit.  The two following figures summarize it nicely:
