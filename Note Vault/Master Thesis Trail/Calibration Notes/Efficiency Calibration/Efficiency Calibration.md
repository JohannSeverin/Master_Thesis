Trying to calibrate the efficiency of the quantum measurement protocol. Sketch the ideas and talk with Jacob is probably the good way of doing this.

Looks like there are three good papers, which I could use:
1. Using the sections from *[[Circuit quantum electrodynamics]] - Blair* to guide the reading. It has a good section describing the result and the general idea of Qubit dephasing.
2. The relation between qubit dephasing and the resonator photon number is described in *[[ac Stark Shift and Dephasing of a Superconducting Qubit Strongly Coupled to a Cavity Field]] - Schuster et al.* 
3. The article *[[General method for extracting the quantum efficiency of dispersive qubit readout in circuit QED]] - Bultink et al.* describes how one can extract it from an experiment.
4. Might also be worth to look at: [[Quantum trajectory approach to circuit QED: Quantum jumps and the Zeno effect]] - Gambetta et al.. Here they use a polaron transformation to eliminate the resonator from the qubits master equation.
