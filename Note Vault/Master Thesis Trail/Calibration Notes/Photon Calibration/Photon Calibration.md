Folder for Photon Calibration Ex

#todo
- [x] Check if steady state is reached
- [ ] Get Single shots saved. Then we can make inset ax for IQ figures
- [x] Focus more close to the actual curvature
- [ ] Does integration weights have an effect? Probably yes, they should probably be fix

Make an experiment python file running the following:
- [x] Calibration (most important is the resonator spectroscopy)
- [x] Qubit Scan over time at a given amplitude (the one we use for readout)
- [x]  Amplitude/X-gate frequency scan.
- [ ] Include single shot data ! 
- [ ] Maybe take adc traces (no scans please!)
