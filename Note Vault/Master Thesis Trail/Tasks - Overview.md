Quick overview of things to do. The overview is made the [[2023-07-18]]. 

The goal post is set approximately, so all the [[#Large Tasks]] and [[#Travel Tasks]] are done by the [[2023-09-01]] and the [[#Projects]] should be started by then and completed by [[2023-10-01]], such that there will be an entire month of writing left.

## Projects 
Bigger projects to focus on. This includes much coding and taking data from the lab. This will probably first be done in August/September. The scope of these projects are around a week or longer. 
- [ ] Cloaking
	- [ ] Relook the theory
	- [ ] Start implementing in experiment
- [ ] Datasets of continuous time. Many subtasks here will be demoted to large tasks when data is taken.
	- [ ] **Explore the data.**
	- [ ] Neural Network Readout Approach (add Qutrit maybe?)
	- [ ] Overhead $\leftrightarrow$ Accuracy - tradeoff
	- [ ] Redo in-measurement calibrations
- [ ] Fitting the entire Master Equation / Stochastic Master Equation. See [[Idea - Brainstorming]]


## Large Tasks 
Projects which is a bit larger. Hopefully the scope of much of this is around one day.
- [ ] Find the proper dynamics between the two level system with decays. (maybe three?)
- [ ] Write common operations on data to function in the analysis module
- [ ] **Do the photon calibration task with Malthe. Data should be easy, and then it is probably just one day to get proper analysis.**
- [ ] Writing Tasks 
	- [ ] Introduction $\to$  Use Sakurai as inspiration to write quantum mechanics in the introduction
	- [ ] Qubit Decoherence. Can probably be split in smaller tasks, but use a day to get going.
		- [ ] Include plots of decay from $|1\rangle \to |0\rangle$ 
	- [ ] Measurements. Find good sources and write about demodulation, homodyne and heterodyne measurement schemes.
	- [ ] Calibrations. Same, do a big push of writing these out with proper simulations from the [[Documentation - QuantumDeviceSimulation]]
	- [ ] Experimental Setup should be covered at least in some detail so it can be written later. Theory about Amplificication and Cooling might be important, so cover that in detail now. 


## Travel Tasks  
This is smaller tasks of a few hours at maximum. I'll save these because they can be done during my travels.
- [ ] Code Documentation for [QuantumDeviceSimulation](Documentation%20-%20QuantumDeviceSimulation)
	- [ ] [[Systems]]
	- [ ] [[Simulation]]
	- [ ] [[Pulses]]
- [ ] Rabi Oscillation Section in the Qubit Control. 
	- [ ] This section should also be expanded to include universal gate set and how to do x, y and z gates
- [ ] Driving the resonator at different frequencies can be added. I made some nice plots and code far back which should be included here. 
- [ ] Write some other properties of the density matrix.
- [ ] Supplement the Q-Function/measurement section with mathematical properties which we still lack.
- [ ] Throw some plots of trajectories into chapter 5.
